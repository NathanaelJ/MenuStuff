## Installation

1. Clone this repository, and open the script using script editor (installed with MacOS).
2. Use file > export and save as an application.
3. Run the application! It's useful to setup 'open at login'

^ I'm fairly confident this isn't the most efficient way to install this, but it works for me.

## Usage

It's fairly self explanatory...
* **Local IP** displays your local IP address
* **Public IP** displays your public IP address
* **Note** lets the user specify text to display in the menu bar, with the option to set a reminder too
* **Stress test** runs a CPU stress test on your mac, but launching 22 instances of the 'yes' shell command, for a specified period of time
